/**
 * Implement the function f that takes n as a parameter and returns a list of size n.
 * The value of the element at index i is the factorial of i if i is even, or the sum of numbers from 1 to i otherwise.
 * 
 * @param n The size of the list to generate.
 * @return A list where each element at index i is the factorial of i if i is even,
 *         or the sum of numbers from 1 to i if i is odd. i starts from 1.
