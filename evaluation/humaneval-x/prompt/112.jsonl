/**
 * Given two strings s and c, delete all characters in s that are equal to any character in c.
 * Then check if the resulting string is a palindrome. A string is called palindrome if it reads
 * the same backward as forward.
 * 
 * @param s The original string from which characters will be deleted.
 * @param c The characters to be deleted from the original string.
 * @return A tuple containing the result string after deletion and a boolean indicating whether
 *         the result string is a palindrome (true) or not (false).
