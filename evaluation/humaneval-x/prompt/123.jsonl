/**
 * Given a positive integer n, return a sorted list of the odd numbers in the Collatz sequence starting from n.
 * The Collatz sequence is defined as follows:
 * - Start with any positive integer n.
 * - Each term is obtained from the previous term as follows:
 *   - If the previous term is even, the next term is one half of the previous term.
 *   - If the previous term is odd, the next term is 3 times the previous term plus 1.
 * - The sequence is expected to eventually reach 1 (Collatz conjecture).
 * 
 * @param n The starting integer for the Collatz sequence.
 * @return A sorted list of the odd numbers in the Collatz sequence starting from n.
