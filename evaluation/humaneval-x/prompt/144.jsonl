 * Determines whether the product of two fractions x * n evaluates to a whole number.
 * Both x and n are string representations of fractions in the format <numerator>/<denominator>,
 * where both numerator and denominator are positive whole numbers.
 * 
 * @param x The first fraction as a string (<numerator>/<denominator>).
 * @param n The second fraction as a string (<numerator>/<denominator>).
 * @return true if the product x * n evaluates to a whole number; otherwise, false.
