/**
* Find x such that poly(x) = 0.
* findZero returns only one zero point, even if there are many.
* Moreover, findZero only takes a list xs having an even number of coefficients and largest non-zero coefficient,
* as it guarantees a solution.
*
* @param xs The list of coefficients of the polynomial.
* @return The zero point of the polynomial.
