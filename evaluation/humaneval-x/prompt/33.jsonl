/**
 * This function takes a list l and returns a list l' such that l' is identical to l in the indices
 * that are not divisible by three, while its values at the indices that are divisible by three
 * are equal to the values of the corresponding indices of l, but sorted.
 *
 * @param l The input list of integers.
 * @return The modified list with values sorted at indices divisible by three.
