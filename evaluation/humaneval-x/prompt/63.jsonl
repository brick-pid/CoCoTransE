/**
 * The FibFib number sequence is a sequence similar to the Fibonacci sequence that's defined as follows:
 * fibfib(0) == 0
 * fibfib(1) == 0
 * fibfib(2) == 1
 * fibfib(n) == fibfib(n-1) + fibfib(n-2) + fibfib(n-3).
 * Please write a function to efficiently compute the n-th element of the fibfib number sequence.
 *
 * @param n The index of the Fibonacci number to compute.
 * @return The n-th Fibonacci number in the FibFib sequence.
