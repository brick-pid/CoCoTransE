/**
 * Given a 2-dimensional data represented as nested lists, where each row may contain a different
 * number of columns, find the integer x in the list and return a list of lists representing
 * coordinates [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], ...] such that each list is a coordinate - (row, columns),
 * starting with 0. Coordinates are sorted initially by rows in ascending order and by columns in
 * descending order.
 * 
 * @param lst The 2-dimensional data represented as nested lists.
 * @param x The integer to find in the list.
 * @return A list of lists representing coordinates.
